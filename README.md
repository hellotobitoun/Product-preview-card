## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt how to work on an actual layout myself. Using CSS reset, deciding between :grid and :flex layouts and how to organize my code within the media query for both mobile and web solutions.


### Continued development

I really want to improve my skills in using utility classes to simplify my designs and creating more seamless layouts between web and mobile.
